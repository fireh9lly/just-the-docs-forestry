# Welcome to VNKit!

VNKit is a plugin that allows you to build a visual novel in Unity by linking together Nodes. It's designed to be easy for beginners to use, but also packs a lot of advanced features to allow you to add developed and interesting gameplay features to your visual novel.

### What's a Visual Novel?

For our purposes, a _visual novel_ is a narrative-focused game where the player doesn't move a character directly (as in an action game), instead experiencing a story through text, sprite-based visuals, and sound. Because they put the focus on storytelling, they are an iconic format for romance and mystery games, but their ability to track complex variables also makes them well suited to handling simulations and gamebook-style RPGs.

VNKit has been designed with a wide range of use cases in mind, from hypertext interactive fiction to visual puzzle-based adventure games, but also designed so that complex features will stay out of your way until you need them. We hope you will be able to invent entirely new genres of visual novel with our plugin.
