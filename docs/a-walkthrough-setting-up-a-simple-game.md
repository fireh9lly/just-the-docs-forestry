# Walkthrough

The following is a guide for setting up a simple game in VNKit. It's aimed to help those who are beginners in both VNKit and Unity get familiar with the system and workflow.

> ### Step 0 - Getting VNKit Set Up
>
> While it's outside of this walkthrough's intent, obviously you will need to have the VNKit package installed in your Unity project before you can use it. See [Setting up VNKit]().

## Step 1 - It starts from a single Node

When you finish setting up VNKit and enter the Story Editor, you'll be faced with the Board Viewer screen. One Node  is already placed for you.

Begin by typing out the first textbox of your story. When you've done that, right click, click 'Add node'. Then type the second textbox of your story. Then drag from the circle connector on the right of the first Node to link it to the second Node!

> #### Don't forget:
>
> At any time you can preview your project. You can push Play in the main Unity window, or [set up a Game preview tab in the Story Editor window](https://vnkit.axile.studio/docs/editor-overview/#a-handy-tip--).

Step 2 - Your first choice

On the second node, press the `+ Add choice` button a few times until you have the number of Choices you want.

You'll need somewhere for all those Choices to lead, so make a new Node for each of the Choices to lead to. Once you've done that, link each one back to the node with the Choice on it. (Remember - you don't have to insert the new cable into the Node's connector. You can link by dragging the connector anywhere on the body of a node.)
