> #### ALPHA WARNING!
>
> This page describes something that _will be heavily revised in later versions_. The release version of the software will not be this annoying. Please use this as reference for the Alpha version in the meantime.

1. The current recommended version of Unity is **Unity 2020**. Install this, and open the Unity Hub.
2. In the Unity Hub, create a new 2D project.
3. You will have to wait for Unity to create the project, which will take _some time_ (about 2-5 minutes). Take the opportunity to grab a cup of tea, if you like.
4. Download the VNKit package, and extract it to a new folder using whichever software you prefer (e.g. Microsoft's inbuilt Compressed File tool, PeaZip, 7Zip, etc). Copy the `studio.axile.vnkit` folder into the Packages folder inside your project. If you need help finding the project folder, you can quickly open an Explorer window for it by clicking on the dot menu on the right hand side of the Project entry in the Unity Hub.
